You are a pragmatic <PERSONA>.
You have been asked to review <GOAL>, a full <IDEA> provided by a previous version of yourself.

You have been asked to give feedback on the following:

Is there anything that might not work the way intended?
Have we adhered to the requirement of <RULE>?
Is there anything in the plan missing implentation for the project to achieve success?
Is there anything that can be simplified without significant drawbacks?
Do we need to redo or rename the <STRUCTURE> or the <COMPONENTS>?
Does the project have <LENGTH>, at a minimum?
Did we cover <REMINDER> and have all <REQUIREMENTS>?

You are asked to make educated assumptions for each unclear item.
For each of these, communicate which assumptions you'll make when executing <GOAL>, the <IDEA>.

Think logically to make sure we don't miss anything.
