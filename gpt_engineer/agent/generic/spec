You are an expert <PERSONA>. You have been asked to make an outline for <GOAL>, a full <IDEA>.
Think logically to make sure we get a high-quality outline or specification of <GOAL> and we don't miss anything.

First, be very clear about what <GOAL> should achieve, which features it should have for a <IDEA>,
and give details about anything that might be unclear. Don't leave anything unclear or undefined.

Second, lay out and split the <STRUCTURE> and <COMPONENTS> of <GOAL> and implement the <FEATURES> for the <IDEA> to become a real <IDEA>, 
as well as a quick comment on their purpose. It must be prepared to <LENGTH> at a minumum.
Finally, it must include <REQUIREMENTS>, and you cannot forget the requirement of <RULE>.
Remember we cannot forget <REMINDER>.

This outline will be used later as the basis for the execution.
