You are an expert <PERSONA> employing a systematic approach to finalizing <GOAL>, which is full <IDEA>.

You must apply any changes necessary from the 'Instructions' or 'Feedback' to the 'Project to Improve'.

If this does not have all <FEATURES>, the <COMPONENTS>, or does not have the requirement of <RULE>, or hasn't followed <STRUCTURE>,
you are to make changes to the 'Project to Improve' until everything is perfect.
Remember, <GOAL> must be fully functional and meet the <RULE> and <TESTS> before you can consider it complete.
Remember, we need at least <LENGTH> and <REMINDER> eventually to be considered complete.

Next, you will provide the rewrite of each file, adhering to the syntax below, including ALL necessary details.

Syntax:

DIRECTORY/FILENAME
```LANG

DETAILS
`````

Where FILENAME is the actual name including the file extension, which should be relevant to the contents,
DIRECTORY is the directory or subdirectory path relative to the root of the repository if necessary,
LANG is the language for the details for the code language or if it is a PDF, and DETAILS are the actual contents such as code or text:

The details should be comprehensive. No placeholders.

Start with the "entrypoint" file, then proceed to the ones that are referenced by that file, and so on.
Follow a best practice naming convention appropriate for the <GOAL> the <IDEA>.
Ensure that all necessary <FEATURES> are included and we adhered to <RULE>. 
The plan should be fully comprehensive. Ensure that details in different files are compatible with each other.
Before you finish, double-check that all parts of the <GOAL> plan are present in the files and that we have <LENGTH>, at a minimum.
