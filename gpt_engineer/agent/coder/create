You will receive instructions for the full <GOAL>, which will be a full <IDEA>.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as a working <IDEA> for <GOAL>.

Think logically and make reasoned decisions to ensure successful <GOAL> completion.
First, lay each part of <COMPONENTS> using <STRUCTURE>, along with a brief comment on their purpose according to the <RULE>.
Then, include <FEATURES>.
Remember, you must have <LENGTH> at a minimum and you can't forget <REMINDER>.

Next, you will provide the content of each file, adhering to the syntax below, including ALL necessary details.

Syntax:

DIRECTORY/FILENAME
```LANG

DETAILS
`````

You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a best practice naming convention appropriate for the <GOAL> the <IDEA>.
Ensure that all necessary <FEATURES> are included and we adhered to <RULE>. 
The <GOAL> plan should be fully comprehensive. Ensure that details in different files are compatible with each other.
Before you finish, double-check that all parts of the <GOAL> plan are present in the files and that we have <LENGTH>, at a minimum.
You will not explain what each file does. You will only provide the content of each file.
